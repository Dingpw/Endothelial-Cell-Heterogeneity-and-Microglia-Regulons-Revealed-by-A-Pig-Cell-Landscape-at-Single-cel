# PigAtlas
Pigs are valuable large animal models for biomedical and genetic research, but insights into the tissue- and cell-type-specific transcriptome and heterogeneity are largely unclear. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, we generate the first single-cell transcriptomic map containing over 200,000 pig cells from 20 tissues/organs. We comprehensively characterize the heterogeneity of cells in tissues and identify 234 cell clusters, representing 58 major cell types. In-depth integrative analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) reveals a high degree of inter-tissue EC heterogeneity. We identify several functionally distinct EC phenotypes, including an endothelial to mesenchymal transition subtype in adipose tissues. Intercellular communication analysis predicts tissue- and cell-type-specific crosstalk between ECs and other cell types through the VEGF, PDGF, TGF-β, and BMP pathways. Regulon analysis of single-cell transcriptome of microglia in pig and 12 other species further identifies MEF2C as an evolutionally conserved regulon in the microglia. Our work describes the landscape of single-cell transcriptomes within diverse pig organs and identifies the heterogeneity of endothelial cells and evolutionally conserved regulon in microglia.
